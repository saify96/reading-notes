- ## Charts are better for displaying data than listed it as a list or even a table.
- ## Chart.js is a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5â€™s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page.
- ## There are mant types of charts such as :
  - ## Pie chart.
  - ## Bar chart.
- ## The HTML < canvas > element is used to draw graphics on a web page via JavaScript.
- ## To show the graphs and the drawing functions for the < canvas > element, we will use a method called getContext().
- ## We have too many commands to draw what we want with the canvas element.
- ## We can record these drawing commands by Path2D object.
- ## To change the colors for the shapes we will use fillStyle and strokeStyle.
- ## To control the transparency we will use globalAlpha property.
- ## Canvas Element allows us to drwa a text and also to style it.
