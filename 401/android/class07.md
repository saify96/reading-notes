# Serverless

> “Focus on your application, not the infrastructure”

- Serverless is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers.

## Pricing
-The cost model of Serverless is execution-based: you’re charged for the number of executions. 
Serverless is reducing cost.

- For Networking the Traditional Architecture is better than serverless.
3rd Party Dependencies The winner here is based on the context.

## Environments
-Setting up different environments for Serverless is as easy as setting up a single environment.

## Timeout

- With Serverless computing, there’s a hard 300-second timeout limit. Too complex or long-running functions aren’t good for Serverless.

## Scale

- Scaling process for Serverless is automatic and seamless, but there is a lack of control or entire absence of control.

## Functions as a Service (FaaS)

- FaaS is an implementation of Serverless architectures where engineers can deploy an individual function or a piece of business logic.

- Principles of FaaS:
  - Complete management of servers
  - Invocation based billing
  - Event-driven and instantaneously scalable

- Key properties of FaaS:

  - Independent, server-side, logical functions
  - Stateless
  - Ephemeral
  - Event-triggered
  - Scalable by default
  - Fully managed by a Cloud vendor
