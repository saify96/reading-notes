- ## We can put a list inside a list to create what's known for nested list.

# Boxes
- ## First of all we must know that the CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.
- ## We can use the CSS to control the properties of these boxes.
- ## We can set the dimensions by pixels and percentages.
#### overflow hidden | overflow scroll

- ## we can use overflow when the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself.

- ## As we can see from the previous image
 - ### The border goes around the padding and content.
 - ### Margin clears an area outside the border
 - ### Padding clears an area around the content.
- ## we can specify border color, style and width.
- ## Display property allows you to choose how the element will be displayed.
- ## The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been.
# JavaScript
- ## An array is a special type of variable and it stores a list of values. 
- ## We will use the array when we working with a list.
- ## we can create the array by using the var keyword followed by the name of the array.
- ## There are two techniques for make an array array literal and array constructor.
- ## Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index.
- ## If-else statement used with condition and set code to be applied if it's ture and another if it's wrong.
- ## The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
- ## if you want to run the same code over and over again you should use the loops.
- ## we use For loop when we know the number of itiration.
- ## we use the while loop when we don't know the number of itiration.
- ## The difference between the while and the while do loop that's the while do will excute the code one at least.
