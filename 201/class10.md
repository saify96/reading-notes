- ## Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.
## ORDER OF EXECUTION 

- ## Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity:
 - ### PREPARE.
 - ### EXECUTE.
- ## JS runs line by line, it will run one line at a time and if there's a need for another statment is stacks the new function on top of the current.
- ## We can Call functions before they have been declared and Assign a value to a variable that has not yet been declared because any variables and functions within each execution context are created before they are executed.
- ## The preparation phase is often described as taking all of the variables and functions and hoisting them to the top of the execution context.
- ## We can check the errors in the console on the browser by Error object.
- ## After we know the error we can do : 1- Debugging. 2-Handling the errors.
- ## ( try..catch..finally ) is a series of blocks that look for errors and capture them before they can crash your program.
- ## JavaScript has 7 different types of errors.
- ## We can set breakpoints by Select the Sources option in the chrome to stop the code at certain point in order to see where is the error .
