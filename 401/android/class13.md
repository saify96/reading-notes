# Amazon SNS

- Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication.

## Benefits

- Modernize and decouple your applications
  - Amazon SNS enables you to modernize your applications and decouple them into smaller, independent components that are easier to develop, deploy, and maintain.

- Send messages directly to millions of users
  - Amazon SNS enables you to send messages or notifications directly to users with SMS text messages to over 200 countries, mobile push on Apple, Android, and other platforms or email (SMTP).

- Automatically scale your workload
  - Amazon SNS leverages the proven AWS cloud to dynamically scale with your application. Amazon SNS is a fully managed service, taking care of the heavy lifting related to capacity planning, provisioning, monitoring, and patching.

- Ensure accuracy with message ordering and deduplication
  - Amazon SNS FIFO topics work with Amazon SQS FIFO queues to ensure messages are delivered in a strictly ordered manner and are only processed once (deduplicated)

- Simplify your architecture with Message Filtering
  - Amazon SNS helps you simplify your pub/sub messaging architecture by offloading the message filtering logic from your subscriber systems, and message routing logic from your publisher systems.
