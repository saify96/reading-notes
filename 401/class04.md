# Object-Oriented Programming.

## object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

## Object

- Objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior.
An object stores its state in fields and exposes its behavior through methods.

- objects provides a number of benefits, including:

  - Modularity
  - Information-hiding
  - Code re-use
  - Pluggability and debugging ease


## Class

- A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.


## Inheritance

- Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.

- The syntax for creating a subclass is simple. At the beginning of your class declaration, use the extends keyword, followed by the name of the class to inherit from.

## An  Interface

- An interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.


## Packages 

- A package in Java is used to group related classes. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code.
- The Java platform provides an enormous class library (a set of packages) suitable for use in your own applications.


### The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10.

### Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits.

### Hexadecimal Numbers;a single Hexadecimal digit can show 16 different values instead of the normal 10.
