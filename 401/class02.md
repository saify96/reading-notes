# Packages and Import

### A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:
  - Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
  - User-defined Packages (create your own packages)

### Package declaration syntax
  - Package statment (optional).
  - Imports (optional).
  - Class or interface definitions.

### Imports
  - If you find a class you want to use you will need to import the class from the packages.
  - To import a whole package, end the sentence with an asterisk sign (*).
  - Import only tells the compiler where to look for symbols so it won't make the file larger.
 
### Loops
  - When we need to execute a statement or a group of statements repeatedly we will need Loops.

- There are four main Loop types in java:
  - Simple for loop
  - Enhanced for-each loop
  - While loop
  - Do-While loop

- For Loop
  - When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop.
- For-Each Loop
  - Used exclusively to loop through elements in an array.
- While loop
  - The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- Do-While loop
  - This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
