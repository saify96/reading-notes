# Amazon S3

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier.
- Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
  

## Advantages of using Amazon S3


- Creating buckets
  - Create and name a bucket that stores data. Buckets are the fundamental containers in Amazon S3 for data storage.

- Storing data
  - Store an infinite amount of data in a bucket. Upload as many objects as you like into an Amazon S3 bucket. Each object can contain up to 5 TB of data. Each object is stored and retrieved using a unique developer-assigned key.

- Downloading data 
  - Download your data or enable others to do so. Download your data anytime you like, or allow others to do the same.

- Permissions 
  - Grant or deny access to others who want to upload or download data into your Amazon S3 bucket. Grant upload and download permissions to three types of users. Authentication mechanisms can help keep data secure from unauthorized access.

- Standard interfaces
  - Use standards-based REST and SOAP interfaces designed to work with any internet-development toolkit.
