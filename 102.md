## Structure
--
### HTML Describes the Structure of Pages.
### Tags act like containers and every container indicate about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
### Tag contains left-angle bracket and the Character ant RIGHT-angle bracket  (characters that sit inside angled brackets).
### <body> Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
### <head> contains information about the page.
### <title> inside the head (the tab name).
### We can add attribute to the opening tag and Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element.
### Attributes made up of two parts: a name and a value separated by an equals sign.
### We can look at how other sites are built by inspect option in google chrome.

## Extra Markup
### We can add information about the web page using the <meta> tag inside the <head> tag.
### We can add comments by using < !-- THE COMMENT -- >.
### We can use the ID attribute in any Html element and due to that it's known for (Global Attribute).
### The ID should be unique for each element.
### The class and ID attribute does not affect the formatting unless we use CSS.
### Block level elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window.
### Inline elements will always appear to continue on the same line.
### We can use the <div> tag to group a set of elements together.
### We can embed a Google Map into our page by <iframe> tag.

## HTML5 Layout
### There are many elements in html5 that help us to make clearer code.
### The <header> and <footer> elements can be used inside the body to separate the top and the bottom.
### The <nav> tag defines a set of navigation links.
### The <article> element acts as a container for any section.
### The <section> tag defines a section in a document.

## Process & Design
### The first question is : Who might be visiting your site?
### Every website should be designed for the target audience.
