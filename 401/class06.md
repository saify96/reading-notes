# Object-Oriented Programming.

## object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

## Object
- Objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior.
- An object stores its state in fields and exposes its behavior through methods.
- objects provides a number of benefits, including:
  - Modularity
  - Information-hiding
  - Code re-use
  - Pluggability and debugging ease

## Class
- A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.

## Inheritance
- Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.
- The syntax for creating a subclass is simple. At the beginning of your class declaration, use the extends keyword, followed by the name of the class to inherit from.

## An  Interface

- An interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.

## Packages 
- A package in Java is used to group related classes. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code.
- The Java platform provides an enormous class library (a set of packages) suitable for use in your own applications.

## Interfaces and Inheritance

### Interfaces
- an interface is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain only constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
- Interfaces cannot be instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes or extended by other interfaces.
- To use an interface, you write a class that implements the interface. When an instantiable class implements an interface, it provides a method body for each of the methods declared in the interface.

### Inheritance

- A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).
- To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.
- A subclass inherits all the members from its superclass.
