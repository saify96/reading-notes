* There are three ways to specify any color in CSS : 
  - rgb values **rgb(0,0,0)**
  - hex codes **#000000**
  - color names **black**
* RGB Values : Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. 
- Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color.
- Brightness refers to how much black is in a color. 
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between the background and the text.

different concept to brightness)
