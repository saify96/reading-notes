## Stacks and Queues

- What is a Stack
  - A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

 - Common terminology for a stack is

   - Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
   - Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
   - Top - This is the top of the stack.
   - Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty   stack  - an exception will be raised.
   - IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

- Stacks follow these concepts:
- FILO
  - First In Last Out
- LIFO
  - Last In First Out

 - Push O(1)
   - Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.
 - Pop O(1)
   - Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.
 - Peek O(1)
   - When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

- What is a Queue
 - Common terminology for a stack is

   - Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
   - Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
   - Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
   - Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
   - Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack  - an exception will be raised.
   - IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

- Queues follow these concepts:

- FIFO
  - First In First Out

- LILO
  - Last In Last Out
