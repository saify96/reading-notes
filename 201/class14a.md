# Transforms
- ## The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element.
- ## There are many properties we can use with transforms like : 2D Rotate, 2D Scale, 2D Translate (x,y,both), 2D Skew and we can use more than one at the same time.
- ## Transform Origin can be used for the horizontal and vertical axes, by select one or two values.
- ## Using 3D Transforms can change elements on the z axis also.
# Transitions
- ## transitions allows us to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occur such as when we hovered over.
- ## There are four transition related properties :transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function and transition-delay.
- ## Transition-duration is The duration in which a transition takes place.
- ## The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move and it's has many keyword such as linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out and each one of them has a cubic-bezier curve
- ## transition-delay determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing.
- ## We can determine all the values in one line by using this order transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and lastly transition-delay.
# Animations
- ## An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
- ## To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition we will use @keyframes.
- ## Animations run their cycle once from beginning to end and then stop.
- ## Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.
- ## The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run.
- ## We can Run Animation in Reverse Direction or Alternate Cycles.
