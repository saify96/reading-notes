- ## CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box.
- ## The blocks are : Block-level or an inline .
- ## A block-level element always starts on a new line.
- ## A block-level element always takes up the full width available.
- ## An inline element does not start on a new line.
- ## An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
- ## The position Property :
 - ### static is not positioned in any special way.
 - ### relative is positioned relative to its normal position.(reserved it's own position)
 - ### fixed is positioned relative to the viewport.
 - ### absolute is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
- ## The element that contains this group of elements is then referred to as the containing element.
- ## The design needs to be able to work on a different sized screens.
- ## Pages can have fixed width or liquid layouts.
- ## Grids help the desginers to style their pages.
